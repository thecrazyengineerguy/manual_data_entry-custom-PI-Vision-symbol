# PI Vision Extensibility Samples and Tutorials

## About
[PI Vision][1] is a web-client vizualization tool for the [OSIsoft PI System][2]. PI Vision 3.0 and beyond supports extensibility through the creation of a combination of html and javascript files. This repository is set up to help you learn how to extend PI Vision in different ways such as a custom symbol or tool pane.

## Repository Sections
This repository is broken down into two separate sections, **tutorials** and **community samples**.

* [Tutorials][3]

    Contains multiple walkthroughs, with documentation, about how to create very specific new symbols in PI Vision.

* [Community Samples][4]

    Contains sample symbols and panes submitted by OSIsoft and the community to showcase what they have done with PI Vision's extensibilty model.

## Resources
* [PI Vision Extensibility Documentation][5]
* [PI Square][6]

## Contributing

Contributions we expect in this repository are focused on the Community Samples, you may open an issue if you see something wrong about the Tutorials and we will review it.

We do welcome everyone to share their PI Vision Extensibility samples and be certain all contributions will be considered. Please make sure that you read our general [contribution guidelines][7] and agree with it; it also contains a lot if useful information. Please keep in mind that integrating your contribution may require some adjustments in your code, if this is the case this will be discussed in the Pull Request you open.

Assuming you already forked and cloned the repository, here is the format we expect for community samples:

1. Create a personal/company folder under the [Community Samples][4] directory
1. Optionally, add a README.md file to that folder telling information about yourself or your company
1. Create a subfolder for your new symbol ( if you add more in the future, you'll add more folders)
1. In the subfolder, add a README.md describing how your symbol works as well as your JS and HTML files needed to use your sample.
